Essay Generation App
This is a Streamlit application that allows users to generate essays on a given topic using the LLama 2 language model. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the essay topic, specify the desired number of words, and select the target audience (essay style).
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Streamlit
LangChain
You can install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install streamlit langchain

Additionally, you'll need to download the LLama 2 model file (models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin) and place it in the specified path within your project directory.
Usage
Clone or download the project repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

Specify the desired number of words for the essay.
Select the target audience (essay style) from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Write" button to generate the essay.
The generated essay will be displayed on the web page.
Code Structure
The main components of the code are:
LLamaFunction: This function takes the essay topic, desired number of words, and essay style as input. It loads the LLama 2 model, creates a prompt template, formats the prompt with the provided inputs, and generates the essay response using the LLama 2 model.
Streamlit app: The Streamlit application sets up the user interface, including input fields for the essay topic, number of words, and essay style. It also handles the submission of the form and displays the generated essay response.
Customization
You can customize the application by modifying the following aspects:
Prompt template: Adjust the prompt template in the LLamaFunction to change the instructions given to the language model.
Model configuration: Modify the model configuration in the CTransformers initialization to adjust parameters like temperature or maximum token length.
User interface: Modify the Streamlit app code to change the layout, styling, or add additional features to the user interface.
Note
Running the LLama 2 model requires significant computational resources and memory. Ensure that you have the necessary hardware and resources available before running the application.
